No squirrels allowed on camera.



Squirrels keep emptying my bird feeder. I wouldn't mind some bird food dissapearing but they empty the whole thing out onto the ground within 24hrs.

This project will blast the bird feeder with water whenever a squirrel is identified on the bird feeder! 



Project is broken into two pieces:
  - A camera Object identifier
  - A webserver that activates a servo pin.
