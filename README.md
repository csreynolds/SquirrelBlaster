No squirrels allowed on camera.



Squirrels keep emptying my bird feeder. I wouldn't mind some bird food dissapearing but they empty the whole thing out onto the ground within 24hrs.

This project will blast the bird feeder with water whenever a squirrel is identified on the bird feeder! 



Project is broken into two pieces:
  - A camera Object identifier
  - A webserver that listens for and activation of a servo pin.





Webserver will activate a relay that controls [this thing](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007N0J98E/).![71gKXfzO3ML _SL1500_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7391197/194972078-d6dd8bff-6919-46bd-a565-0914aeb73dca.jpg)
